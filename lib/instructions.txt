Welcome to Battleship.

You can press return to return to the main screen at any time.

The games sequence is as follows:
- The computer will layout its ships.
- You will be asked to place your ships (i.e. A1 A2 for the two length ship)
- Then we will play.
- You will go first.
- We will display the board.
- Then ask you for the position you want to fire at (A1)
- We will tell you if it was a hit or miss and update the map.

Then the computer will go:
- We will show you your map
- The computer will tell you where it fired
- We will tell you whether it is a hit or a miss and update the map.

Once someone's ships are all sunk, the game is over.

Good Luck!
